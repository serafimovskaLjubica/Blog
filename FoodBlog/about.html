                    HI, MY NAME IS
                lindsay! <br>
                And Food Blog is my little corner of the internet! <br>

                I'm the voice, author, and creator behind Food Blog. What started as a casual hobby over 14 years ago in 2010 while I was working as a fourth grade teacher has now grown into a full-blown business (!!) that reaches millions of people with fun recipes each month, with content that has been featured on The Kitchn, CNN, Refinery29, Brit + Co, POPSUGAR, Huffington Post, The Everymom, PureWow, and more. <br>

                I live in Saint Paul, MN with my husband Bjork and our dog Sage. My favorite things in life are a big plate of pad Thai, sunny days, and going to the dog park.<br>
                <hr></hr>
                <br>
                I Love Food!
                In this space, I am always sharing fresh, flavorful, (mostly) healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual, every day life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put in on the blog. My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable AND exciting, whether you’re cooking for yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so excited about these recipes that you eagerly await 5pm when you can go home from work and start cooking.
